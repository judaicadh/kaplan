Dee and Arny’s shared passion for the past led them into collecting. The Kaplans began collecting in the early 1970s at
Renninger's Antique Market near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. They also traveled to paper and book shows in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, and New England. Beginning in the early 1980s, they became active in auctions in New York. With the growth of
the World Wide Web in the 1990s, the Kaplans discovered yet another source for collectibles. In addition to the Arnold
and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica, the Kaplans also built a small collection of American non-Jewish
material in the course of their decades of collecting
together. <u> [The  Arnold and Deanne Kaplan collection of Americana](http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/ead/detail.html?id=EAD_upenn_rbml_MsColl1094)</u> (
not to be confused with the Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica) consists of printed works, manuscripts, and
photographs, which they also have donated to the Penn Libraries.
