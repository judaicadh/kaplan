### Filters and Facets

* **Form** : Choose document type(s) (e.g. pamphlets, trade cards, ledgers )
* **Topic**: Select topic(s) to narrow down your search (e.g. Military, Arts & Professions).
* **Language**: Restrict to items in English, Hebrew, German, or any other indexed language.
* **Geography**: Pick one or more places where an item was created or used.
* **Name**: Search for people or organizations associated with the item.
* **Date Range**: Slide or enter "from" — "to" years (e.g., 1800 — 1850) to see only items dated within that span.
* **Collection**: Limits search results to a subset of the Kaplan collection. The Kaplan Collection of Early American
  Judaica is selected by *default*.
* **Subcollections**: Filter by subcollections within the larger Kaplan Collection (e.g. Willy Lindwer Suriname
  Collection)
* **Only Show Items with Images**: Toggle to show only items that have a digitized image available (or vice versa).

In the example shown below, you can see the various filtering and faceting options in action.

_**Tip**: Combining several facets (e.g., Geography + Date + Topic) is the fastest way to zero in on exactly the
materials you need._

### Item Page

* **Metadata Panel:** The metadata panel for each item offers information on the title, creator/contributor, date,
  place, physical location, and subject headings associated with the item.

* **IIIF Viewer:** The images that you see to display the item are served by the [IIIF Protocol](https://iiif.io/).
  Images come from [Colenda](https://colenda.library.upenn.edu/). If you want to access the Colenda Record, you can do
  so by opening the information panel on the image viewer.


* **Multiple IIIF Manifests:** You can toggle between multiple manifests associated with an entry by using the bar that
  appears above the image viewer.

* **Favorite an Item:** You can add an item to your favorites by clicking on the heart icon next to the title.

* **Linked‑Data Exports**: There are JSON‑LD, Dublin Core, and RDFa snippets embedded in page source for bibliographic
  integrations.

### Geography Pages

items from the collection that have the same geographic metadata.

### Subject Pages

On an item page, clicking a subject heading lets you explore other items in the collection with the same subject.
Subject headings are also linked to external data sources, displayed as icons beneath the page title. On the far left,
you’ll find variant forms of the subject name (when available) sourced from the Library of Congress's Linked Data
Service.

### Favorites Page

**NOTE:** _The Favorites feature uses your browser’s cache to store selections. If you switch browsers or clear your
cache, your saved favorites will be lost._

above. To view your full list of favorites, click the heart icon at the top of the page. This will take you to your
Favorites page, where all saved items are displayed.
