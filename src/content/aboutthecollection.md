The Penn Libraries holds the Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica, a
collection of 13,000+ items (and counting), valued in excess of $12 million. It is the most
important private collection of its kind, documenting the social and economic development of
early Jewish life in the Western Hemisphere. The core of the Kaplan Collection covers the period
before mass Jewish migration to the Americas in the late 1880s.

## The Early American Judaica Collection

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    The Arnold and Deanne Kaplan Collection of Early American Judaica, donated to the University of
    Pennsylvania Libraries in 2012 by the Kaplans, and growing each year, teaches us about the everyday
    lives, families, businesses, communal institutions, religious organizations, voluntary associations,
    and political circumstances of Jewish life throughout the western hemisphere over four centuries. It
    provides a unique window into the changing character of colonial life and culture around the Atlantic
    world and within the United States. It documents changing perceptions and experiences of new worlds of
    space and time, not only from the perspective of its Jewish colonists and citizens but also in the
    context of the larger societies in which they have lived. The collection, in short, is more than the
    sum of its parts. It is the constellation of unlimited potential connections among its many pieces
    from the time of colonial settlement in the sixteenth century into the era of mass migration at the
    end of the 19th century.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8">A Collection Unlike Any Other</h2>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    The Kaplans’ core collecting focus over the last half-century has been on the evolution of Jewish
    business life in the Americas. So, for example, early cartographic evidence in the collection marks
    colonial Jewish plantations in Surinam and the Caribbean as well as merchant activity in Atlantic port
    cities throughout the western hemisphere. Unique financial records reveal the trading activities
    of Jewish family businesses during the 18th and 19th centuries. Manuscript ledgers and correspondence
    from the late 18th century document Jewish commercial networks in North America, such as the expansion
    of the fur trade in upper Michigan and French Quebec. Just as notably, thousands of ordinary sources
    of information detail the daily struggles of Jewish peddlers, craftsmen, and small business owners.
    Bill heads - a type of printed form listing the products, prices, seller's name, date and other
    pertinent information – offer an archival trove for studying Jewish-owned businesses. Individual
    treasures also may be found such as a beautiful set of five of the rarest advertisement cards for the
    Levi Strauss clothing business that supplied pants worn by the “forty-niners” during the California
    Gold Rush. These primary sources have been avidly collected by the Kaplans and trace the growth
    and connections among Jewish businesses in the U.S. South, Midwest and Far West throughout the 19th
    century. </p>

<p class="text-center font-semibold text-lg italic text-gray-800 mt-8">
    Thanks to the Kaplan Collection, we now have the ability to study and analyze in precise detail a wide
    spectrum of Jewish business experiences, i.e., degrees of success and failure represented by great
    wealth, moderate prosperity, the working poor, and those in need of charity.

    he Kaplan Collection contains diverse format types, including what may be single largest collection of
    early Jewish photography in the United States. These photographs, produced by Jewish
    photographers and Jewish-owned photographic businesses, depict both non-Jewish and Jewish subjects,
    including what may be the earliest photograph of a carver of a Jewish tombstone. Noteworthy
    photographs include Civil War–era photos, for example, of the devastation in Richmond, cartes de
    visite, portrait (or studio) photos, and dozens of stereoscopic images, the nineteenth-century version
    of 3-D glasses. </p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    The Kaplans took a keen interest in all types of artistic expressions, visual as well as craft, of
    Jewish life in the Americas.Their collection includes original oil paintings that date from the
    eighteenth century, most from the nineteenth century, some in their original frames, as well as
    textile samplers, pastels, watercolors, handwritten sketches, and lithographs. There are
    three-dimensional, museum-quality artifacts, including presentation silver. The collection contains
    rare flatware with the stamps of Jewish silversmiths, and silver bowls of historic significance, such
    as one inscribed and given to a member of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites (the first
    Jewish lobbying/defense association, established in New York City in 1859). There also are
    examples of the first American glass ever blown to make bottles with raised Hebrew lettering.
    Among the unusual three-dimensional artifacts is a Civil War–era pistol owned by Jonas Levy, an
    officer in the U.S. Navy and the younger brother of Uriah P. Levy, the nation’s first Jewish naval
    commodore. This pistol, as well as an oil painting of a naval ship, and a shaving mug, were
    owned by Jefferson Monroe Levy, the son of Jonas Levy, and were kept at Monticello. Jefferson’s
    uncle Uriah Levy had purchased Monticello in 1834. During the Civil War, Monticello was seized
    by the Confederacy and sold but afterwards was reclaimed by Jefferson Levy after a lengthy court
    battle. On repossession, Monticello was in a state of terrible disrepair. Jefferson Levy then
    undertook to restore the historic home at great personal expense. The Kaplan Collection has numerous
    documents relating to the Levy family and the fate of Monticello. </p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
    The Kaplan Collection has an abundance of materials that relate to Jewish service in the military,
    first in colonial militias, in the course of the American Revolution, in the wars in which the United
    States engaged in the nineteenth century, and on both side of the bloody divide between the North and
    South during the U.S. Civil War. From the French and Indian Wars in the mid-18th century are
    documents of Jewish merchants who provisioned the colonial British army; a unique handwritten business
    ledger kept by the Jewish merchant David Salisbury Franks between 1774 and 1776, while he resided in
    Montreal, Canada bears witness to his place as the first Jew to be jailed for supporting the American
    Revolution; from the War of 1812, there may be found the first known example of a Presidential pardon
    in a case involving an American Jew, Uriah P. Levy, who served as a witness in the court proceedings
    concerning acts of piracy and murder on the high seas (the aforementioned Levy famously would later
    become the first American Jewish naval Commodore); from the U.S. Civil War, there exists a watercolor
    drawing by Max Neugas, a Confederate Jewish prisoner of war, of the Union Barracks at Fort Delaware
    where he was held from 1863 until the war's end in 1865. </p>

    Though mainly focused on original manuscripts and unique works of fine and folk art, the Kaplan
    Collection also contains approximately three hundred fifty volumes of rare printed books, serials, and
    pamphlets. Among them are a remarkable variety of landmark first edition imprints of Judaica
    Americana, such as Judah Monis’s Hebrew grammar <em>Dickdook Leshon
    Gnebreet</em> [Ivrit, i.e., Hebrew]. Printed in Boston by Jonas Green in1735 with
    Hebrew font imported from London, this grammar is regarded as the first Hebrew textbook in colonial
    America. ; The Kaplan Collection also holds the second such grammar, authored by Samuel Sewall and
    printed in Boston in 1763, which is the only other Hebrew grammar published in North America before
    the nineteenth century. The grammars of Monis, a convert to Christianity, and Sewall, a Christian
    Hebraist, bear witness to the early Protestant American interest in the language of the Old Testament.
    In fact, students were required to study Hebrew as part of the early standard curriculum at Harvard,
    where both men taught. Also found in the Kaplan rare print collection is the <em>Essai
    historique sur la colonie de Surinam</em> (Paramaribo [Suriname], 1788) by David Nassy, which contains
    the first history of the Jewish settlement of that Dutch colony. Nassy, a physician who came to
    Philadelphia during the yellow fever epidemic of 1793, successfully treated the city’s inhabitants,
    defying the bloodletting method employed by Dr. Benjamin Rush. The printed record of how he did
    it, based on his experiences in tropical Suriname, is also in the collection: <em>Observations on the
    Cause, Nature, and Treatment of the Epidemic Disorder, Prevalent in Philadelphia</em> (Philadelphia:
    Parker & Co. for M. Carey, 1793). Also noteworthy is the first children’s book by a Jewish
    author (Isaac Gomez), which is accompanied by a printed approbation from former President John Adams
    pasted inside its cover; the first Jewish almanac (<em>lu’ah</em>), printed by Moses Lopez (the Kaplan
    copy once belonged to Rebecca Gratz and contains her handwritten notes); and what is perhaps the first
    bar mitsvah sermon printed in the United States.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
    The Kaplan Collection also contains important original source materials documenting the history of
    Atlantic Jewish emancipation and the beginnings of modern Jewish politics. For example, you find the
    original printing of the British Plantation Act of 1739, which granted Jews and other non-subjects in
    the colonies’ naturalization. You find primary sources that tell the story of how Jews became
    American citizens, how their constitutional rights were secured, and how their state rights were
    eventually won. You can learn too about painful episodes of oppression, anti-Jewish antagonism, both
    social and political, the conflicted position of Jews on opposite sides of the American Civil War.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
    The collection of rare early American newspapers includes reprintings of the famous letters of
    congratulations sent by the Jewish congregations of the new republic to George Washington on the
    occasion of his inauguration as the first president of the United States.Found here is perhaps the
    most important exchange in American Jewish letters, that between Moses Seixas, representing the Jews
    of Newport, and Washington, in which he famously echoes Seixas’ phrase “to bigotry no sanction.” The
    phrase heralded a new epoch for Jews as citizens of a republic entitled to the same rights and
    privileges as all other (male) citizens. Remarkably, the Kaplan Collection holds copies, some in mint
    condition, of the contemporary newspaper reprintings of the letters from all six cities (Newport, New
    York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah). Other newspaper accounts, pamphlets, and
    broadsides bear witness to painful episodes of resistance to Jewish civil rights such as occurred
    during the legislative debates over the Maryland Jew Bill to rectify the exclusion of Jews from
    serving in that state’s assembly, political infighting during the Jacksonian era, and in other moments
    of anti-Jewish antagonism, both social and political, such as the Mortara Affair in 1858, an
    international uproar caused by the Vatican’s defense of the secret baptism of a Jewish infant who
    later was taken from his parents to be raised as a Catholic.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
    Finally, in the field of American Jewish religious history, the Kaplan Collection contains unique
    documents of the history of observant Judaism in early America. While some histories of early American
    Jews have focused on forms of assimilation, secularization or reform, the Kaplan Collection, without
    neglecting any of these traditional subjects, meanwhile paints an entirely different canvas of
    religious renaissance and revival.
